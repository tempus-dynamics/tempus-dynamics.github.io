# Participant Documents
The participant documents page provides access to any and all files uploaded or generated in regard to an individual participant, including the date they were uploaded/created and their visibility level. At the top of the page, an interface is available to upload new files for the participant including support for changing the file name, adding freeform file tags, and specifying the access level of the file.

Multiple files may be uploaded at once, but the file name override functionality is only available when uploading singular files.

## Modifying Files
After being uploaded, file properties such as the file name, tags, and access level may be edited at any time by clicking the pencil icon. Files may also be deleted by clicking the trash icon.

!!!danger
Deleted files only have a brief soft-delete window in which they may be recovered. If a file is unintentionally deleted via the admin portal, please contact Tempus Dynamics immediately.
!!!

## Visibility Level
The visibility level of a file indicates who has access to a file from among the following:

- **Public** - the file is available on a public page
- **Participant** - the file is available on the [participant dashboard](/nexus/participant-dashboard.md)
- **Admin** - the file is only available in the admin portal

## Malware Scanning
All uploaded files are subjected to malware scanning as a precaution, and a link to download the file is not made available until a scan is completed. Typically, scans will be completed within seconds. If a file is unavailable for an extended period of time, please contact Tempus Dynamics regarding the issue.

!!!danger
No malware scan can be 100% accurate. Never allow scripts or executables to run from downloaded files!
