# Participant Notes
The participant notes page provides a log for the viewing and creation of notes about participants. Notes are combined for the entire family and listed at the bottom of the page in order from newest to oldest. Each note lists the date of its creation, the name of its author, the method of creation, the reason for the note's creation, and the content of the note itself.

## Note Methods
The method field is used to identify the source of a note. By default, each note created from the participant notes page is recorded as an `Internal Note`. Notes are also sometimes created from other system components, such as Inquest (the Tempus survey platform) or certain Nexus functions. For example, every update made to the participant status via the participant details page is automatically recorded in the notes section for the participant.
