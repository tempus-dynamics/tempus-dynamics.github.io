# Admin Tasks
The admin tasks page provides a high-level overview of active and completed admin surveys in your registry, allowing quicker completion of many similar tasks across multiple participants. The interface presented here is similar to the  [participant tasks](/nexus/admin-portal/participant-tasks.md) interface, but also includes the participant's name and [primary identifier](/nexus/glossary.md#identifier) as a reference.

Additional administrative functions may also be added to the navbar on the admin tasks view as-needed. Contact Tempus Dynamics to request a new feature in the admin tasks navbar for your registry.
