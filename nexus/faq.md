# Nexus FAQ
Frequently asked questions about the Nexus platform.

## How do I test survey assignments?
You can access all the necessary tools to test survey assignment in the Admin Portal. As a best practice, please follow these steps:
1. Check the currently assigned surveys for the participant (and any relevant family members) on the Tasks page.
1. Click "Auto-Assign Surveys" to make sure all survey assignments are up-to-date.
1. Check the participant's properties to make sure they meet the appropriate criteria for all surveys.
1. Update any properties (if appropriate) to trigger the correct assignments (survey assignments are automatically re-evaluated whenever participant properties are changed).
1. Contact Tempus to diagnose or resolve any lingering issues.
