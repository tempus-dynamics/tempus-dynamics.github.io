# Participant Dashboard
The participant dashboard is the participant's main interface with the Nexus platform. The dashboard can be customized with various modules and features, including a unique registry logo and other instructional text. Each account holder has their own dashboard, which displays all dependent participants for whom they have authority and the tasks assigned to them.

## Impersonation
From the [participant details](/nexus/admin-portal/participant-details.md) page, administrators have the ability to impersonate any account holder in the registry. While impersonating, the administrator sees exactly what the participant sees on the participant dashboard, with the addition of a prominent impersonation banner.

## Nav Menu
On desktop, participants will be presented with a nav menu at the top left of the screen, allowing quick access to key sections of the dashboard. On mobile devices, the nav menu will be hidden by default but accessible via the burger menu icon at the top left corner of the screen.

## Sections
The participant dashboard is divided into several modular sections, each with its own functionality.

### Activities
The activities section displays the account holder's next priority task, as well as individual active and completed tasks for each family member. When priorities for different events and participants match, the oldest event will be presented first. Additionally, each time the participant logs into their dashboard, a pop-up message will alert them to their next priority task.

Each family member is listed in order by their priority, with tasks divided into the active and completed sections. By default, the active tasks section is expanded for each participant and the completed tasks section is collapsed, and the participant may freely toggle each section to collapse or expand. Active tasks are presented with button links to begin the associated task, while completed tasks instead display the date they were completed.

### Invites
The family invites module includes button links to add or invite other family members to participate in the research study. The inner content of the module may also be customized with instructional text and/or graphics.

### Account Settings
The account settings section provides the participant with an interface to update any editable properties that have been defined for the circle for each individual in the family that the account holder has authority to access. This section utilizes the same functionality as the [Participant Details](/nexus/admin-portal/participant-details.md) page, including a configurable grid layout. After selecting a family member from the provided dropdown, all of that individual's visible and editable properties will be presented.

!!!warning
When determining the layout for the account settings page, it's important to remember that the majority of users will access this site using a mobile device. For this reason, some properties and widgets available in the Participant Details page are not supported in the Participant Dashboard.
