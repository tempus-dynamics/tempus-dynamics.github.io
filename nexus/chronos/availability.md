# Availability
The availability interface is provided to users with calendars setup through the Chronos system. From this page, you can manage your own schedule settings for each event linked to your account. To create a new event or change the events you have access to, please contact Tempus Dynamics for assistance.

If you do not have any default hours or flexible hours set, users will not be able to schedule new appointments with you.

## Default Hours
You can set your default weekly hours of availability per-event by selecting an event from the Event Type dropdown, then adding, removing, or modifying the hours shown. You may also set your title and time zone per-event. Changes to your hours will not impact appointments that are already scheduled; to clear appointments that are already on your schedule, you must request a reschedule for each appointment separately.

!!!warning
Hours set here are not shared across different events. Changing your hours in one event will not change them for any other event. It is not currently possible to automatically sync your default hours between different events.

## Flexible Hours
In addition to default weekly hours, you may also add flexible hours to your schedule. These hours can be set manually to any future date and time, and planned out as far in advance as needed. Free hours added here will be added to the availability presented to users on top of your default hours. You may also add busy hours to your schedule via this interface to exclude the specified hours from your schedule.

!!!warning
Hours added here will be incorporated into your availability for ALL events linked to your calendar. It is not currently possible to add flexible hours for individual events.
