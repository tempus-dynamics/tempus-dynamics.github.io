# Batch Requests

## What is a batch request?
A batch request is what will define the desired invite criteria and target counts. Typically, in-clinic/handoff projects will vary in batch requests based on the clinic and staff schedule or how responsive families, parents, or subjects have been. A batch request can be set up to invite as little as 1 participant, or as many as 6,000 participants.

## How does the batch request process work?
You will receive an email each Friday morning containing links to the project's batch history and a short survey in which you can define the batch criteria and target count. The batch survey will need to be submitted by the end of day each Monday in order to invite new participants that Wednesday. If there is still an active batch survey available in our system, an email reminder will be sent on Monday morning.

If you have questions about your batch request contact us via email at [batchrequest@sparkresearchmatch.org](mailto:batchrequest@sparkresearchmatch.org).

## Email Example
The email you will receive will look similar to the example below. There will be links to assist you in making your batch request including this documentation, your study batch history and templates, your study Researcher View, and your study Insight report dashboard.

To setup your new batch, simply click the Setup Batch button in the email.

This will open the Setup Batch survey where you can enter in the criteria, repeat the last batch criteria, specify the number of new to invite, add a second batch with different criteria, etc.

## No batch for the week?
You can click directly in the email that you will not be batching for the next Wednesday, just below the Setup Batch button.
