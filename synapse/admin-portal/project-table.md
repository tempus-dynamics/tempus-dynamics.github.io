# Project Table

The projects page serves as your home page within the Synapse Admin Portal. This searchable table provides links to all the projects to which you have been granted access, organized into one of three categories:

 - **Active** - the project is live and collecting data
 - **Inactive** - the project has been completed and is now disabled
 - **Testing** - the project is in a testing state, which may or may not be functional
