A group with an OR conditional evaluates to true if any of its component elements evaluate to true, or false if all of its component elements are false. The optional NOT parameter also allows for the inversion of any group's evaluation, meaning that any NOT group will evaluate to true if it normally would return false and vice versa.","Groups can be nested inside of other groups as deeply as necessary to create infinitely complex and detailed queries.

In general, when querying against any data that is not included on the participant details page, it is important to properly group queries to isolate distinct components. Grouping will automatically be applied beginning from the highest level for which a relevant parameter exists.","For example, to create a query to determine if a participant completed two distinct tasks, each task component should be isolated within its own parameter group so that the query will create distinct subqueries for each task group. Any task rules that are applied across task groups will result in a combined subquery that applies the parameters of both groups together.","Task criteria variations","In the above image, the first group of parameters represents an invalid query, while the other two groups represent an equivalent and valid representation of the same query. Group 1 will be executed as a query requesting \"assigned tasks that are both Task A and Task B,\" which will always evaluate to false.

Clicking on each specific row will also expand a detailed preview of the specific message contents and a table of click rates for individual URLs contained in that email.","Participant communications tab."]},{"l":"Email Delivery","p":["The delivered date indicates when an email message was successfully delivered to the target email address. A successful delivery verifies that the email address is valid and capable of receiving messages, but it does not necessarily mean a participant has opened the email."]},{"l":"Clicks vs Opens","p":["The primary performance indicators to evaluate whether a participant has actually opened an email are clicks and opens. Opens are recorded using a hidden image appended to the email contents, which increments each time the email is opened by the participant. Clicks are recorded each time the participant clicks on any link within the email (excluding mailto links).","Due to the open metric's reliance on loading an image, it may sometimes be blocked by anti-spam features. This may result in scenarios where the open metric has a value of 0 but one or more clicks are recorded. For the most reliable numbers, clicks should be considered in most circumstances."]},{"i":"bounced-dropped-and-spammed","l":"Bounced, Dropped, and Spammed","p":["The bounced, dropped, and spammed dates indicate failure or rejection of an email message:","The message was rejected by the receiving server. This may indicate the address doesn't exist, the mailbox is full, or there was some other technical reason that the message could not be delivered.

A relationship may also be linked with itself (e.g. sibling& sibling). When a relationship is edited via the admin portal, it will not be considered valid unless Description 1 is a linked relationship to Description 2 and vice versa, or both are \"Other\" relationships."]},{"l":"Position","p":["For validation purposes, each description may be configured such that it will only be permitted in a specific position (i.e. as Description 1 or Description 2). This can be used to strictly limit parents to the first position and children to the second position."]},{"l":"Connection","p":["In addition to the relationship roles and descriptions, each relationship must specify a connection that encompasses both of its halves (e.g. biological). If a connection is not specified, a value of Other will be used by default."]},{"l":"Authority","p":["The authority field dictates whether Person 1 has authority for Person 2, therefore the ordering of Person 1 and Person 2 in a relationship may have a semantic difference when considering authority. Relationships are thus generally considered to be directional, such that Person 2 is always equal or subordinate to Person 1. The possible authority designations include:","Person 1 has no authority for Person 2. Person 2's name will still be visible on the dashboard, but their data will not be viewable or editable by Person 1.","Person 1 has full authority for Person 2. Person 2 will be able to edit Person 1's data and complete surveys on behalf of Person 1.","Duplicate relationships are not permitted between Nexus participants, including reversed relationships. Therefore mutual authority (in which Person 1 and Person 2 both have authority for one another) is not currently possible."]},{"i":"other-relationships","l":"\"Other\" Relationships","p":["In addition to pre-defined relationships, free-form \"Other\" relationships may also be used.
